# Promise Sequence

In JavaScript there is **Promise.all()** to execute and arbitrary number of promises in parallel and there are the chains of Promise to execute a fixed number of promises in sequence. However there isn't a method to execute an arbitrary number of promises in sequence.

## Project Description

To solve the problem above I built a function called promiseSequence
